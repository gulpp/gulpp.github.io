## Notes
The below list is in no specific order. The list is mostly applicable to the United States of America USA. However, many ideas & proposed policies listed below are nation-state-agnostic.

## Goals
The goal is to continuously (and transparently) evolve & improve the below list over time based on new knowledge & information, namely, data, debate, and facts. Critical thinking, logic- & evidence-based reasoning, open-mindedness, scientific method, and self-criticism - all atop a foundation of love of/for humanity, Planet Earth, biological life, and the Universe - are fundamental to the GULPP.
